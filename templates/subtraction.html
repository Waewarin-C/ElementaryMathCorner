        <h2>What is Subtraction?</h2>
            <p><strong>Addition </strong>is when we take two or more numbers and joining it together to make a
                bigger number.</p>
            <p>When we read or say a subtraction problem we say, "A number minus another number equals a smaller
                number".</p>
            <!--Insert picture of subtraction problem with how to say it-->
            <h3>Different Parts of a Subtraction Problem</h3>
                <!--Change color of bold words-->
                <p>The number that is being subtracted from is called the <strong>minuend</strong>.</p>
                <p>The number that is doing the subtracting is called the <strong>subtrahend</strong>.</p>
                <p>The answer to a subtraction problem is called a <strong>difference</strong>.</p>
                <!--Insert picture of subtraction problem with labels-->
            <p><b>Note: </b>The order of the numbers matter when subtracting. For Example, 9 - 3 is NOT the same
                as 3 - 9</p>
    </div>

        <h2>Subtracting Using Columns</h2>
            <p>Like addition, we can write a subtraction problem from top to bottom instead of from left to right.
                When we do that, the numbers will make a column. This can be used to subtract as many
                numbers as we want.</p>
            <p>To subtract numbers using columns, we do the same thing as addition except we write a minus sign and
                the answer is the difference.</p>
            <!--Insert picture of subtracting in columns examples-->
            <p>This is also a common way to subtract numbers with two or more digits.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Subtracting with Two or More Digits</h2>
            <p>To subtract numbers with two or more digits, we will use columns. To do this, write one number below
                the other, while making sure the place values line up.</p>
            <p>Then subtract the numbers one column at a time.</p>
            <!--Insert picture of subtracting numbers with two or more digits-->
            <h3>What Happens When there are Numbers that have More Digits Than Others?</h3>
                <p>Don't worry, just like with addition we write the numbers the same way as when both numbers have
                    the same number of digits.</p>
                <p>Then subtract the numbers one column at a time</p>
                <p>For the columns that don't have any numbers to subtract, we simply bring it down. We can also think
                    of it as the number minus an invisible 0.</p>
                <!--Insert picture of subtracting where a number has more digits than others-->
        <h3>Borrowing</h3>
            <p>Sometimes when we subtract numbers in a column, the top number is smaller. When that happens we do
                what is called <strong>borrowing</strong>.</p>
                <p>This can happen on any column or on more than one column in a subtraction problem.</p>
                <p><b>How to Borrow</b></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Borrow from the next column. For example, if we're on the ones column, we borrow from
                            the tens columns, and if we're on the tens column, we borrow from the hundreds column.</li>
                        <li>When we borrow, we are always borrowing 10, so we add 10 to the number that is borrowing.</li>
                        <li>Cross out original number and write the new number on top. This is now the number we are
                            going to be subtracting from.</li>
                        <li>Do the subtraction for the column.</li>
                        <li>Move on to subtracting the next column.</li>
                        <li>If the top number for that column is smaller, repeat the steps.</li>
                    </ol>
