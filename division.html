        <h2>What is Division?</h2>
            <p><strong>Division </strong>is when we split a number into groups where each group has the same number.</p>
            <p>There are different ways we can think of division:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If we take a number and split into a certain number of groups, how many are each group?</li>
                    <!--Insert picture of splitting number into a number of groups-->
                    <li>If we take a number and split into groups of a number, how many groups with we have?</li>
                    <!--Insert picture of splitting number into groups of a number-->
                </ul>
            <p>There will be times when we break a number into groups that we will have a number left over.</p>
            <!--Insert picture of splitting number with a remainder-->
            <p>When we read or say a division problem we say, "A number divided by another number equals a number".</p>

            <h3>Different Parts of a Division Problem</h3>
                <p>The number being divided is called the <strong>dividend</strong>.</p>
                <p>The number doing the dividing is called the <strong>divisor</strong>.</p>
                <p>The answer to a division problem is called a <strong>quotient</strong>.
                <p>The number left over is called the <strong>remainder</strong>.</p>

                <p>The order of the numbers matter when dividing.</p>
                <p>30 รท 3 is NOT the same as 3 รท 30</p>
                <p>A division problem can also be written with a slash (/). Like this: 30 / 3</p>
            <p><b>Note: </b>We cannot divide by 0!</p>

        <h2>Division Quick Tips</h2>
            <p>A number divided by 1 equals itself.</p>
            <p>A number divided by itself equals of 1.</p>
            <p>We can't divide by 0! This is important because the answer will something called
                <strong>undefined</strong>.</p>
