        <h2>What is Division?</h2>
            <p><strong>Division </strong>is when we split a number into groups where each group has the same number.</p>
            <p>There are different ways we can think of division:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If we take a number and split into a certain number of groups, how many are each group?</li>
                        <p>For example, if there are 30 dolphins, and they swim in three groups, how many dolphins are
                            in each group? There would be 10 dolphins in each group.</p>

                            splitting a number into a number of groups.";>
                    <br><br>
                    <li>If we take a number and split into groups of a number, how many groups with we have?</li>
                        <p>For example, if there are 30 fish, and we have three of them in each tank, how many tank
                            tanks do we have? We would have 10 tanks.</p>

                            splitting a number into groups of a number.";>
                    <br>
                </ul>
            <p>When we read or say a division problem we say, "A number divided by another number equals a number".</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <h3>Different Parts of a Division Problem</h3>
                <p>The number being divided is called the <strong>dividend</strong>.</p>
                <p>The number doing the dividing is called the <strong>divisor</strong>.</p>
                <p>The answer to a division problem is called a <strong>quotient</strong>.</p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <p>A division problem can also be written with a slash (/).</p>

                <br>
                <p><b>Note: </b>The order of the numbers DO matter when subtracting. For Example, 30 รท 3 is NOT the same as 3 รท 30.</p>
            <p><b>Note: </b>We cannot divide by 0!</p>

        <h2>Division Problems that Don't Divide Evenly</h2>
            <p>There will be times when we can't break a number into groups evenly and we will have a number left over.</p>
            <p>The number left over is called the <strong>remainder</strong>.</p>
            <p>For example, if we have 25 doughnuts and we share it with four people, how many does each person get? Each person would
                get six doughnuts each, but there will be one doughnut left over.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="images/division/Division_With_Remainder_and_Shapes.PNG" alt="Division problem that has a remainder with shapes";>
            <br>
            <p>If the division problem has a remainder, after the quotient we write "R" followed by the remainder.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="images/division/Division_Problem_Remainder_With_Labels_1.PNG" alt="Division problem that has a remainder with labels way 1";>
            <br>
            <p><b>Note: </b>We can also write lowercase "r".</p>
            <br>
            <img src="images/division/Division_Problem_Remainder_With_Labels_2.PNG" alt="Division problem that has a remainder with labels way 2";>
            <br>
            <p>When the division problem has a remainder, we say, "A number divided by another number equals a number with a remainder
                of a number". </p>

        <h2>Division Quick Tips</h2>
            <p>A number divided by 1 equals itself.</p>
            <p>A number divided by itself equals of 1.</p>
            <p>We CANNOT divide by 0! This is important because the answer will something called
                <strong>undefined</strong>.</p>
