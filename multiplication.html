        <h2>Multiples Tips and Tricks</h2>
            <h3>Multiples of 0</h3>
                <p>The only multiple of 0 is 0 itself.</p>
            <h3>Multiples of 1</h3>
                <p>Every number is a multiple of 1</p>
            <h3>Multiples of 2</h3>
                <p>Multiples of 2 are even numbers</p>
            <h3>Multiples of 3</h3>
                <p>
                    A number is a multiple of 3 if the digits in the number add up to a multiple of 3.
                    This can be done until you're sure the sum is a multiple of 3. You can keep adding the
                    digits until the sum is a single digit and see if the sum is a 3, 6, or 9, which are
                    multiples of 3. Good for bigger numbers!
                </p>
            <h3>Multiples of 4</h3>
                <p>
                    A number is a multiple of 4 if the digit in the tens and ones place make a number
                    that is a multiple of 4. In other words, if the number made of the last two digits is a
                    multiple of 4. Or if the ends in 00.
                </p>
            <h3>Multiples of 5</h3>
                <p>The last digit, the digit in the ones place is a 5 or a 0. The number ends in a 5 or a 0.</p>
            <h3>Multiples of 6</h3>
                <p>A number is a multiple of 6 if the number is a multiple of 2 ADD and multiple of 3.</p>
            <h3>Multiples of 7</h3>
                <p>
                    A number is a multiple of 7 if you take the last digit of the number and times it by 2,
                    then take that and subtract it from the number without the last digit. If the answer is a 0
                    or a multiple of 7, then number is a multiple of 7. If still unsure, you can keep going by
                    repeating the steps with the next digit.
                </p>
            <h3>Multiples of 8</h3>
                <p>
                    If the digits in the hundreds, tens, and ones place make up a number that is a multiple of
                    8, then the number is a multiple of 8. In other words, a number is multiple of 8 if the
                    number made up by the last three digits is a multiple of 8. Or the number ends in 000.
                </p>
            <h3>Multiples of 9</h3>
                <p>
                    If the sum of the digits is a multiple of 9. Can keep going until the sum is a single digit
                    and see if it is a 9.
                </p>
            <h3>Multiples of 10</h3>
                <p>The last digit, the digit in the ones place is a 0. The number ends in a 0.</p>
            <h3>Multiples of 11</h3>
                <p>
                    Add every other digit starting at the first number. Add every other digit starting at the
                    second number. If the difference between the two numbers is 0 or a multiple of 11, the
                    number is a multiple of 11.
                </p>
            <h3>Multiples of 12</h3>
                <p>Multiples of 12 are multiples of 3 AND multiples of 4</p>
