        <h2>What is Subtraction?</h2>
            <p><strong>Subtraction </strong>is when we have a number and we are taking another number away from it.</p>
            <img src="images/Subtraction_With_Shapes.PNG" alt="Subtraction problem with shapes";>
            <p>We can think of it as starting with a number and count down from it.</p>
            <img src="images/Subtraction_With_Number_Line.PNG" alt="Subtraction problem with a number line";>
            <p>When we read or say a subtraction problem we say, "A number minus another number equals a number".</p>
            <img src="images/Subtraction_In_Words.PNG" alt="Subtraction problem in words";>
            <h3>Different Parts of a Subtraction Problem</h3>
                <p>The number that is being subtracted from is called the <strong>minuend</strong>.</p>
                <p>The number that is doing the subtracting is called the <strong>subtrahend</strong>.</p>
                <p>The answer to a subtraction problem is called a <strong>difference</strong>.</p>
                <img src="images/Subtraction_Problem_With_Labels.PNG" alt="Subtraction problem with labels";>
            <p><b>Note: </b>The order of the numbers matter when subtracting. For Example, 9 - 3 is NOT the same
                as 3 - 9</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Subtracting Using Columns</h2>
            <p>Like addition, we can write a subtraction problem from top to bottom instead of from left to right,
                making columns.</p>
            <p>To subtract numbers using columns, we do the same thing as addition except we write a minus sign and
                the answer is the difference.</p>
            <img src="images/Subtraction_In_Columns.PNG" alt="Subtraction in columns";>
            <p>This is also a common way to subtract numbers with two or more digits.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Subtracting Two-or-More-Digit Numbers</h2>
            <p>To subtract two-or-more-digit numbers, we will use columns just like with addition. To do this,
                write one number below the other, with the place values lining up.</p>
            <p>Then subtract the numbers one column at a time.</p>
            <img src="images/Subtraction_With_Two_Digits.PNG" alt="Subtracting numbers with two digits";>
            <h3>What Happens When there are Numbers that have More Digits Than Others?</h3>
                <p>Don't worry, just like with addition we write the numbers the same way as when both numbers have
                    the same number of digits.</p>
                <p>Then subtract the numbers one column at a time</p>
                <p>For the columns that don't have any numbers to subtract, we simply bring it down. We can also think
                    of it as the number minus an invisible 0.</p>
                <img src="images/Subtraction_With_More_Digits.PNG" alt="Subtracting numbers where a number has more digits";>
        <h3>Borrowing</h3>
            <p>Sometimes when we subtract numbers in a column, the top number is smaller. When that happens we do
                what is called <strong>borrowing</strong>.</p>
            <p>This can happen on any column or on more than one column in a subtraction problem.</p>
            <p><b>How to Borrow</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Borrow from the next column. For example, if we're on the ones column, we borrow from
                        the tens columns, and if we're on the tens column, we borrow from the hundreds column.</li>
                    <li>When we borrow
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li>We are always borrowing 10, so we add 10 to the number that is borrowing.</li>
                            <li>The number we are borrowing from will now be 1 less.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>Cross out original numbers and write the new numbers on top, for both numbers. These are now the
                        number we are going to be subtracting from.</li>
                    <li>Do the subtraction for the column we are on.</li>
                    <li>Move on to subtracting the next column.</li>
                    <li>Remember to use the new number borrowing. If the top number for that column is smaller, repeat
                        the steps.</li>
                </ol>

                <img src="images/Borrowing_One_Column_Step_2.PNG" alt="Borrowing in one column step 2";>
                <img src="images/Borrowing_One_Column_Step_3.PNG" alt="Borrowing in one column step 3";>
                <img src="images/Borrowing_One_Column_Step_4.PNG" alt="Borrowing in one column step 4";>
                <p>This is what borrowing in multiple columns looks like.</p>
                <img src="images/Borrowing_Multiple_Columns.PNG" alt="Borrowing in multiple columns";>
            <p><b>What Happens if We are Borrowing From a Zero?</b></p>
                <p>There will be times when the number to borrow from in the next column is a 0, but how are we supposed
                    to borrow from a number that has nothing to borrow from?</p>
                <p>Don't you worry, there is an easy way for us to borrow from 0.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Have the 0 borrow from the number in the column next to it.</li>
                        <li>We can now borrow from the first 0 that now become 10.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <img src="images/Borrowing_From_Zero_Step_4.PNG" alt="Borrowing from zero step 4";>
                <p>If there are many zeros in a row</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Keep on going until we get to a 0 that can borrow from a number that is not a 0.</li>
                        <li>Have that 0 borrow from its next column.</li>
                        <li>Now the 0 before that can borrow from this last 0 that has become a 10.</li>
                        <li>Then the 0 before that one can now borrow.</li>
                        <li>Keep going until the first 0 has borrowed.</li>
                    </ol>
