    <h1>Addition</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>What is Addition?</h2>
            <p><strong>Addition </strong>is when we take two or more numbers and joining it together to make a
                bigger number.</p>
            <p>When we read or say the addition problem we say, "A number plus another number equals a bigger
                number".</p>

            <h3>Different Parts of an Addition Problem</h3>
                <!--Change color of bold words-->
                <p>The numbers being added together are called <strong>addends</strong>.</p>
                <p>The answer to an addition problem is called a <strong>sum</strong> or <strong>total</strong>.</p>

            <p><b>Note: </b>The order of the numbers don't matter when adding. For example, 7 + 4 is the same as
                4 + 7</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Adding Using Columns</h2>
            <p>Another way to write an addition problem is to write the numbers from top to bottom instead of from
                left to right. When we do that, the numbers will make a column. This can be used to add as many
                numbers as we want.</p>
            <p>To add numbers using columns, we do
                <ol>
                    <li>Write the numbers from top to bottom</li>
                    <li>Write the plus sign on the left side of the numbers</li>
                    <li>Draw a horizontal line under the last number</li>
                    <li>Then we just add the numbers and write the sum below the line.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <img src="images/Addition_In_Columns.PNG" alt="Addition in columns" style="width:700px;height:250px";>
            <p>This is also a common way to add numbers with two or more digits.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Adding Numbers with Two or More Digits</h2>
            <p>To add numbers with two or more digits, we will add using columns. To do this, write one number below
                the other, while making sure the place values line up.</p>
            <p>Then add the numbers one column at a time.</p>
            <img src="images/Addition_With_Two_Digits.PNG" alt="Adding numbers with two digits" style="width:550px;height:250px";>
            <h3>What Happens When there are Numbers that have More Digits Than Others?</h3>
                <p>When that happens, don't panic, we just write the numbers the same way as when both numbers have the same
                    number of digits.</p>
                <p>Then add the numbers one column at a time</p>
                <p>For the columns that don't have any numbers to add, we simply bring it down. We can also think of it as the
                    number plus an invisible 0.</p>

            <h3>Regrouping</h3>
                <p>Sometimes when we add numbers in a column, the sum is greater than 9. When that happens we do what
                    is called <strong>regrouping</strong>.</p>
                <p>This can happen on any column or on more than one column in an addition problem.</p>
                <p><b>How to Regroup</b></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Take the sum and regroup into the tens and ones places</li>
                        <li>Write down the ones digit</li>
                        <li>Write the tens digit on top of the next column. This is called <strong>carrying over</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Move on to adding the next column. Don't forget to add the number that was carried over.</li>
                        <li>If the sum for that column is greater than 10, repeat the steps.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>This is what regrouping in multiple columns looks like.</p>
